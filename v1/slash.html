            <p><b>slash</b> - a writing system (.)--Oo(.)][</p>
            <p>growing up bilingual (spanish/english) i always had a particular interest in language and how living things communicate. i mainly attribute this to my need to really study both instead of just being able to absorb them. i love etymology, and where linguistics intersects with neuroscience and anthropology. about 2 years ago i started developing my own writing system, i had been obssessed with ancient writing and the history of written language and the purpose it served as the basis of governement, religion, and the basis for extended human collaboration and coexistence (culuture) if we are the hardware language is software that runs on our operating system (conscious/unconcious). the writing system consists of a decontructed latin alphabet. i wanted it to look like how whispers sound when you are just far away enough to hear it as just air and vibrations shaped by the speakers lips.

            <img style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;" src="assets/slash-art.jpg" alt="art i made with slash the writing system i created for myself">
<p>how long would it take me to learn to write it fluently? how long before i could look at a page with my name on it would my brain register it as my name with as much ease as it does: " salva " ?</p>
<p>ii OO//o+(- --ii<<(- +][ii(.) (=o// ))Oox_(.)</p>

<p>after about two years, it still takes me a bit more time than writing regularly but i can read it pretty quickly. almost as if i blur my eyes i see it for what it is. "art is a transmission device for feelings" - (quote) so what is language? transmission of thoughts and i can write it in my own way now. has anyb9dy ever told you: ii --o\./(- x_ou ?
