            <p>another node in the net. this one is mine. a seed, from a different dimension. i breathe life into you. a folder- a root filesystem a directory cyberSoul catach all. human OS interacting with the digital. 3D printed syllables as i express my soul on liquiid keyboards. from one arragnements of atoms to an arragemnet of pixels. a beginning. a breathe a step. </p>
            <p>today i did mushrooms and walked through nature. i feel very alone. i thought of steve jobs. i saw the braiding in my hair, i saw the interlaced braiding of the roots and branches, of the waters flow patterns coming together into infinite fractal vertices. </p>
            <p>a chief without a tribe, i thought about websites and the psychedlic rogue nature of the internet. our attempts at a wood wide web. we have interlinked ourselves through lithium and silicon. our next wars are meant to be fought over these. file tree, root directory, stream some music, branch out, synchronize. green glow and the sound of cicadas </p>
            <br>
            <p>lots of thoughts. low energy. do more was the lesson. be an active participant in your own life. do more. do more for others. be useful. first prinicples fundamental understadning and use it to be useful to help others</p>
