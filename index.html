            <h3>hanging</h3>
            <br>
            <p>number 1 step of becoming
ingobernable

is to be healthy
the healthier the more energy can be divested into pursuing curiosity, into learning, into growing 
</p> <p>
being stronger and more agile
the body is a holistic system of systems all dependent on one another
to be a human in motion 
to be a human sourceeee

‚Äúonce you understand the way broadly enough, you see it in all things‚Äù
</p>

we are a complex combination and ever changing interaction of chemical compounds 

we can‚Äôt control most be we can control 
what we ingest, what we eat and drink and consume
food and digital diets


dead hanging from a bar is so relaxing
doing cardio i learned to repetitive loop meditation
through stretching i learned i learned presence 
through moving weight in controlled movements i learned patience and got my ego checked, certainty and measurement
if you care about something you measure it
that is science

experience can‚Äôt be measured 
but as my consciousness floats like smoke through the 5000* layers of reality i can create. i can turn to mist and crystallize on command. i have free will. i have agency. i can become i or dissolve to nothing and be everything 

faint whispers of a story in a place 
something like florida but in a cyberpunk future
desert jungle beach  nomads
digital native, trabalingua, white fur covered apes with the limbs of a serpent, hands many hands, in limbo, in ecstasy, a hurricane of ideas, spiraling spiraling spiraling carving a new reality
rhythmic drum, tribal paint
i am becoming
psilocybin trail runner
i am becoming a rhythmic drum
echoiing exhooing
my soul transcended and became bits and pieces transmitted over bluetooth and wifi 

as i walked next to the stream today
i streamed consciousness through a human body

            <p>another node in the net. this one is mine. a seed, from a different dimension. i breathe life into you. a folder- a root filesystem a directory cyberSoul catach all. human OS interacting with the digital. 3D printed syllables as i express my soul on liquiid keyboards. from one arragnements of atoms to an arragemnet of pixels. a beginning. a breathe a step. </p>
            <p>today i did mushrooms and walked through nature. i feel very alone. i thought of steve jobs. i saw the braiding in my hair, i saw the interlaced braiding of the roots and branches, of the waters flow patterns coming together into infinite fractal vertices. </p>
            <p>a chief without a tribe, i thought about websites and the psychedlic rogue nature of the internet. our attempts at a wood wide web. we have interlinked ourselves through lithium and silicon. our next wars are meant to be fought over these. file tree, root directory, stream some music, branch out, synchronize. green glow and the sound of cicadas </p>
            <br>
            <p>lots of thoughts. low energy. do more was the lesson. be an active participant in your own life. do more. do more for others. be useful. first prinicples fundamental understadning and use it to be useful to help others</p>
