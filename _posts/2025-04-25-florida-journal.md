go-to song recently like past 2 days has been ESP by N.E.R.D. 
today we went to small local gallery / statue garden and ate some food and painted pottery
i had missed making something physical 
i want to paint more

i have a lot of ideas and i want to write more \
these weight i carry seems to be a lot from not giving into my creative nature as much as i used to. 
i have no set creative habit, well i guess writing these is one i am building
\ 
i have been having a lot of ideas for liquiid metal but am so intimidated. i dont know if i have the skill to express these ideas as well as they deserved to be expressed
need to double down on creation. time to run the experiment of "going pro"* 
to be defined 

need to sit and write out everything i want out of this life. spent some great time in the sun today. feeling grateful
\ so appreciative of coffee and matcha paired with a joint in the morning
