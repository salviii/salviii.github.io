spending a lot of time alone. i finally did my work and feel like a brand new fucking person. elated. i forget life can be fun because i procrastinate.
my avoidance of pain leads to constant suffering

anyway now i gladly work on my fun projects
adding some glitching text effect to the site using chatgpt vibe coding am i brainless or evolving?
