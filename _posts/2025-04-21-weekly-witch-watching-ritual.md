lead the charge  
shocked  
a battery of fervor  
acid to the base  
fragile foundation  
archaic in form, modern wisdom  
applied science  
by design  
god given man made  
homegrown by design  
aspiring cult founder  
"the revolution will be telepathic"  
the structural integrity of water  
bound to you  
free to me
