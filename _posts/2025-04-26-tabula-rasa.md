this change i have craved for years must take place. i feel like a loser like a failure because i know i can live in a
more structured and fulfilling way and i am not living up to that standard. time to end the \
cycle of hedonism and self loathing and begin a life of experimentation, experience, abundance, and love. \
a balanced health, creative, and social life. \

i want to begin this experiment of experience by clearing the slate \

[ENTER] tabula rasa image

meaning i want to clear the slate, start with 0 debt (or as close as financially possible without this becoming an
excuse to procrastinate) fast, throw away sell or donate most of my things. start from scratch. a full reset.

clear cut delete remove as much of the daily life pile up messiness. reduce as many things as possible including emails
logins digital files my computer consolidate, narrow down, minimize everything. this must be done before adding and
beginning new ways of life. an overhaul of the old. system reset

plan of action :
consolidate emails and logins to important things
    everything on salviglesias@gmail.com
    stuff like my bank can go under salvi404unknown@gmail.com
    bank chase and discover, irs id.me website, school, hostinger and other domain hosts, cargo, github, instagram, twitter, robinhood, contact lists, insurance, apartment website
go through all my clothes if i don't feel comfortable in it out reduce so most of them can fit my northface bag, i don't need much more than that.
all paper, knick knacks revise meaningful items consolidate to one medium box
can keep skecthbooks ofc 

get rid of all food
clean out my car remove everything from it like i am going to sell it. 
consolidate all those papers and have them ready in a folder

update driver's license to mami's house


((i want to never ever be caught off guard, james bond level organization and have everything at the ready))



i don't want to feel weighed down by stuff, i have accumulated too much and i feel inconvenieced by a lot bc it's mostly just a mess.
my space and mind are too cluttered so when i want to do something it is met with tons of physical and mental resistance.

TABULA RASA
a clear slate

pay off my credit card debt and research a new one that i can accumulate points with and use to travel
get organized- everything must have it's place. everything of quality and versatile. 
minimalism, break a way from the social construct of needing/wanting so much.
less is more.
less interference with natural states.
