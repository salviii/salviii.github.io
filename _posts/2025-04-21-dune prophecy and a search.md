i love dune. still believe first book by frank herbert is one of the best things ever written by a human being.

i just started watching dune prophecy bc i never really gave it the attention when it first came out. it's based around the bene gesseritt one of my favorite characters/asepects from the book/movies.

they are monk witches truthspeakers mind controllers political advisors. how do i get that job?
they live and exist in a way i wish i lived more like.

they are all about mind over body control
breathework
education
they are very buddist resisting pain handling suffering
deeply focusing on task

i love that about dune in general. the human body and mind are tools for ideas

a human life intoxicated by an idea. living through them. like a virus
some of the scariest scenes in the epics or in history are when a human invokes or calls upon the power of god(s)
summoning something transcendtal becoming a conduit a vessle for the energy

i miss that level of passion
what do i need? to be bored more often. to act on it? as i am writing this taking the ideas and thoughtws seriously maybe here is a thread that will unravel the fabric of reality so i can bend it to my will.

do i need to be more present? meditate be healthy remove some veils from my interactions with the reality
smoke less. connect more with the way
truth through sun & steel
the unrelenting undeniable inevitable way 
the dao? how does one exist there. prayer?
just some thoughts
