just finished setting up this blog. i had thought about it for months. i had been doing a lot of writing and posting it
a long with my photos on instagram but i don't like instagram all that much and haven't had the app on my phone in a
while so i don;t go on it as often but now i have my own outlet. thank god for the internet thank god for open source.
full transparency. i am here now. 

hopefully now that i went ahead and built this i will be more encouraged to write
every day. maybe just checking in with my self day to day. idk what i keep waiting for. i keep procrastinating
distracting myself and not executing on my ideas. not ever bringing them to life therefore not living mine becuase it
weighs on me. i have been doing a lot of exploring this year. travelling a lot so i could write about that, but also
self discussing my ideas on language writing etc. we'll see any way i want to post this now so i;m gonna stop writing
because i want to see what it looks like on the website.
