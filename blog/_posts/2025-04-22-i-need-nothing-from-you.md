to need nothing from no one
is that to be free? to want your company. not need it.
to want to win, not need to.

do i have self esteem issues? is my confidence a mask i wear to have a bareble reflection looking back at me in the mirror

i want to be less demanding on others. be demanding on myself. be reliable
but i also dont feel like people care about me. maybe my mom in a way. but how can i know people care when they refuse to be present with me?
am i unbearable or is it your reality you can't stand?

i don't want to be sticky
i want to flow. i need nothing from you
desire is the root of all suffering so i guess i don't even want anything from you
how do i beomce abundant? i don't need your joy i got enough for us? how do i real life that
am i really just a victim to the chemical, hormonal, neurological ecosystem of my mother's womb. is my capacity for stress and love forever set in stone

is there enough neuorplasticity for me to remold my thought and how it interacts with the phyiscal world
less podcasts, less distractions, practice gratitude, listen to music, instead of this constant becoming--- just be 

hi salva

i have always wanted my own name
